This is release 8.0 of the ParseAPI. Currently, this library is
available for the x86[_64]/Linux, x86/Windows XP/2000/20003, and
POWER/Linux platforms.

Documentation for the API can be found at

    http://www.dyninst.org/

as well as in the doc/ subdirectory.


Prerequisites
--------------------------

The ParseAPI is a component of the Dyninst system, and depends on two other
components: the SymtabAPI binary format library and the InstructionAPI
disassembly library. Both of these components should have been included in the
package containing the ParseAPI; if not, they can be obtained from the
dyninst.org website.

The SymtabAPI has further dependencies depending on the platform, including
libelf and libdwarf. See the SymtabAPI documentation for details.


Compiling the library
--------------------------

The ParseAPI is built from the top-level Dyninst directory. For UNIX-like
systems, The top-level Makefiles are generated by running the ./configure
script, which sets platform-specific options. The configure script will attempt
to determine the build platform automatically; if it cannot not, you must
specify the correct platform by exporting the PLATFORM environment variable
with one of the following values:

    i386-unknown-linux2.4       Linux 2.4/2.6 on an Intel x86 processor
    x86_64-unknown-linux2.4     Linux 2.4/2.6 on an AMD-64 processor
    i386-unknown-nt4.0          
    ppc32_linux                 Linux 2.6 on a 32-bit PPC processor
    ppc64_linux                 Linux 2.6 on a 64-bit PPC processor

Compile the ParseAPI and its Dyninst component dependencies by typeing 
`make ParseAPI`.

On Windows systems, a Visual Studio solution is provided in the top-level
directory.
