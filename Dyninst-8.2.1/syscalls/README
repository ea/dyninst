System header files (unistd*.h) should be placed in Platform-specific files.

NOTE: unistd.h from Linux/ppc contains both 32- and 64-bit syscall numbers.
This file has been copied to the Arch_ppc32 and Arch_ppc64 directories and
manually edited to reflect architecture-specific system call information.
