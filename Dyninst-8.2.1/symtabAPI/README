        *** Symtab 8.0 Release Notes ***

This is the version 8.0 release of the SymtabAPI.  Currently, the API
library is available for ELF platforms (Linux, BlueGene), and PE
platforms (Windows).

Documentation for the Symtab API can be found at:

    http://www.dyninst.org/


Prerequisites
-------------

On Linux, Symtab requires some libraries that are not installed by default
in most distributions.  The first is libelf, which is included with most
distributions and can be installed using the distribution's package manager.
The second is libdwarf.  You can get the latest source code distribution
of libdwarf from http://reality.sgiweb.org/davea/.  RPM files for libdwarf
are also available from various sites.  

Building the SymtabAPI from source
------------------------------------

If you downloaded the source distribution of this package, you can
build the SymtabAPI libraries by running "make" in the core directory
(one level up from where this README file is located).  On Unix
platforms, you must use GNU make.  The top-level makefile contains
directives for compiling the Paradyn parallel performance tool, from
which the SymtabAPI was derived.  If you have downloaded only the
SymtabAPI, you will see a number of messages about missing
directories.  These directories are needed only for making Paradyn, so
you should ignore these messages.  If you downloaded the entire
Paradyn distribution, you can make only the API libraries by running
"make SymtabAPI" in the core directory.


Changes since 6.1
-----------------
- Support for rewriting dynamic binaries on PowerPC/32, PowerPC/64 and BlueGene/P platforms
- Support for rewriting static binaries on x86 and x86_64 platforms
- Speed and space optimizations
